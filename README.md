  - Functions uses various python libraries for the ease of use such as getch to take input without pressing enter everytime,

# How to modify project for personal use :)

  Currently project is a Shop/Store management system having three csv files about products, employees and complaints.
  Variables are stored in source/variables.py

  # Suppose we want to make a Flight management system,
  - we can change complaints.csv seperately in any text editor
  - We can change employees.csv to passesngers.csv and change entries like salary to flight time and plane no, etc
  - We can change products.csv to flights.csv where it contains flight info
       - Note :: changing file name will result in error so make sure to change file name inside code too (app.py) (using find and replace)
  - Now make changes in variables.py and change keywords like employees to passengers, products to flights,etc.

  - Go through the code and make some changes as your wish wherever you find it neccessary,
  - # Now Your Flight Management System is ready.
